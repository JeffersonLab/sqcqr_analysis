# To control how many generation of secondaries (tracks and their hits) to save,
# there is a configuration:
#    /rootOutput/saveSecondaryLevel <ancestry-level>
#
# <ancestry-level> sets 0-n levels of ancestry which are saved in root file.
#
# Example:
#
# -1 - save everything
# 0 - save only primary particles
# 1 - save primaries and their daughters
# 2 - save primaries, daughters and daughtersâ€™ daughters
# n - save n generations of secondaries
#
# (primaries - particles that came from a generator/input file)
#
# The default level is 3, which corresponds to:
#
# /rootOutput/saveSecondaryLevel 3
#
# We set it to 2. If only vertex particles are of the interest, set it to 0
